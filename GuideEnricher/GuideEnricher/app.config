      This section allows you to create mappings from names in the 
      guide data (i.e., SchedulesDirect) to names in thetvdb.com.

      You need this because the names are not always equal.  It comes
      in handy for shows that have the same name a really old shows....
      Like Chase on NBC needs to have a mapping to Chase (2010) to help 
      this tool find the proper series.

      Use the logs to help debug.

      If a direct name mapping does not work, you can use thetvdb.com
      show ID as a direct map as shown with $..! My Dad Says below.

   -->
   <seriesMapping>
      <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="American Dad" tvdbComName="American Dad!" />
      <seriesMap schedulesDirectName="$..! My Dad Says" tvdbComName="id=164951" />
   </seriesMapping>
